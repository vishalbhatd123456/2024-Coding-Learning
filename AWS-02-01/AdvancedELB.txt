ELB Allows configuration files in the form of JSON or yaml which can be a part of the source bundle - in the .ebextensions or the .config folder

example:

{
    "option_settings":
    [
        {
            "namespace":"aws::elasticbeanstalk:application",
            "option_name":"My app health check URL",
            "value":"/healthcheck"
        }
    ]
}
This configures an application health check url that will be used by a LOAD BALANCER to know if the application status is healthy

Further more ELB configuration :

1) buildfiles: allows to run and execute these files for a short perion and EXIT
 upon the task completion

 ==> Inculde within the root directory. 


 proc file:

 key value pair of <process_name>:<command>


 platform hooks:

 proviioned to run some processed by the ELB during some stage of the deployment process
 stored in dedicated directory

 .platform/hooks/prebuild:

 files that you want ELB to run before it builds up configures the appln and web server

 .platform/hooks/predeploy:

 Files that you want to run after it sets up and configures the application and web server but before it deploys them into final runtime location

 .platform/hooks/postdeploy:

 files that run after the ELB deploys the application

 this is the last deployment workflow step
