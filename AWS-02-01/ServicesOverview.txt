SQS : Distributed Message Queuing system that allows to decouple the components of an application so that they are independent.

SQS is pull based, not push based.


SQS Queues :

Stanard ; best effort ordeing, message delivered atleast once, occasional duplicates 


FIFO ; Message orders are striclty happening,


Visibility Timeout : When the amt of time that the message is invisible in the SQS Queue after a reader picks up that messge. default is 30s. >30s - requeuedback

Short polling - A response is returned immediately even if the messages are not int he queue. this can result in lot of empty response

Long polling : periodically polls th queue and only returns the response when a message is in the quue or the timeout is being increased

Options of post pone deliveries, Delay periods

Larger files in the queueus : s3 bucket


SNS - Does not received the msgs - provides a pub/sub model and supports fanout, push notifications.
